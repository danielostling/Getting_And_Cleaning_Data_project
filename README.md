Getting And Cleaning Data project
=================================

This is my project repo for the Johns Hopkins Coursera course "Getting And 
Cleaning Data".

The task of this project was to perform an analysis of motion tracking data 
and to store the result into a so-called tidy data set. See 
http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf for details on what tidy data set 
means.


The code to perform the analysis of the UCI data set is in run_analysis.R.

The data on which the analysis is done is taken from 
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

To perform the analysis, unpack the data archive and note the name of the 
folder you unpacked into. Edit run_analysis.R and set the variable 
"vecCharDataPath" in the function "main()" to the path you unpacked into.

# Course project, Getting And Cleaning Data
# by Daniel Ã–stling 2014
#
# This program should work with only base R, no libraries needed.
#
# The goals of this program are:
# 1. Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.
# 2. Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each 
#    measurement.
# 3. Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
# 4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
# 5. Create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each 
#    variable for each activity and each subject.
#

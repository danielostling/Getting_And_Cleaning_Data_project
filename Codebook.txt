This file describes the tidy data set produced by run_analysis.R, described 
in README.md. The features in the tidy data set are based on the features in 
the UCI motion tracking data sets. For an explanation of them, please see the 
files "README.txt", "features_info.txt", "features.txt" and 
"activity_labels.txt" in the UCI data archive.

The tidy data set is based on the combination of the training and the test 
data sets from the UCI data archive. In the tidy data set, the features are 
the ones in the list below. They are all calculated features, except the 
last two, "Activity" and "Subject".

The "Activity" feature is one of six activities, described in the files in 
the UCI data archive, and the "Subject" feature is an identifier that ties 
an observation to one participing subject.

The rest of the features are referred to as calculated features. They are 
each grouped on activity and subject. The grouping is done such that for each 
combination of activity and subject, all observations were extracted from the 
combined UCI data sets. All features for averages/means or standard deviation 
were kept, and the rest of the features were dropped. Then, the average for 
each remaining feature was calculated, and saved in the resulting tidy data 
set.

The names of the features in the tidy data set, seen in the list below, are 
based on the names of the features in the UCI data sets. To get the feature 
names below, characters -, ( and ) were replaced with a dot, ".". Then dots 
were removed so that a maximum of one consecutive dot remained. Finally, any 
trailing dots in the feature names were deleted.

PLEASE NOTE: For easier mapping between features in the tidy data set and the 
UCI data sets, I've retained most of the feature names. However, the features 
in the tidy data set is actually an AVERAGE of observations as described above.
